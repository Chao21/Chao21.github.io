IrriMap_CN [version 2]: Improved annual irrigation maps across China in 2000–2019 based on satellite imagery and machine-learning method
-----

Here we developed annual irrigated cropland maps across China (IrriMap_CN) at 500-m resolution from 2000 to 2019, using MODIS data, machine-learning method, and Google Earth Engine platform. The spatial reference system of this dataset is EPSG: 4326 (WGS-1984).

Readers can refer to the following publications for more details on the methods.
