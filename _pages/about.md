I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering at the National University of Singapore](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/). I earned my Ph.D. degree from the [Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.igsnrr.cas.cn/), in June, 2023. Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees at [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. I also have four years of experience in the electrical surveying industry, which has enriched my interdisciplinary perspective and technical expertise.

My research focuses on exploring the Earth's processes through satellite observations combined with statistical modeling and machine learning techniques. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of environmental systems and welcome opportunities to engage in discussions and collaborations. Outside of research, I enjoy reading and staying active through swimming and running.
Please feel free to reach out to connect or collaborate!
