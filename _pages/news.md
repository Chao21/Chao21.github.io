**December 2024**

* I attended the AGU fall meeting at Washington D.C, 2024. This is my first time and I am astonished by the grand community of Earth science.
* On this conference, I gave an Oral presentation "Widespread spillover effects of irrigation on water availability in the United States" on 10th December, and a Poster presentation "AI-driven High-resolution Rice Yield Prediction Aided by Satellite Data" on 13th December.


**June 2024**

* [Paper online] My co-authored paper publised on *Scientific Data*, generating a new cropland map in Southwest China: "Validation and refinement of cropland map in southwestern China by harnessing ten contemporary datasets". Please check here https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03508-5 for details.
  

**January 2024**

* [Paper online] My co-authored paper publised on *The Crop Journal*, evaluating six high-resolution cropland maps in China: "Decoding the inconsistency of six cropland maps in China". Please check here https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2023.11.011 for details.
  

**September 2023**

* I accept the offer from National University of Singapore and am to begain the new career as postdoctoral Research Fellow in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

**June 2023**

* [Congratulations] I succeed to pass my dissertation defense and become a DOCTOR of Philosophy now! Yes, I finally graduate from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. Thanks to my tutors Prof. Quansheng GE and Prof. Jinwei DONG, thanks to my family, and, thanks to me for my persistence and endavors.


**March 2023**

* [Paper online] My first-authored paper publised on *Agricultural and Forest Meteorology*, introducing the declined cooling effects of irrigation in Norhwest China during the last two decades due to increasing water-saving technology: "Attenuated cooling effects with increasing water-saving irrigation: Satellite evidence from Xinjiang, China". Please check here https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109397 for details.



**January 2023**

* [Paper online] My first-authored paper publised on *Agricultural and Forest Meteorology*, introducing the cooling effects of irrigation expansion on land surface temperature: "Characterizing spatial, diurnal, and seasonal patterns of agricultural irrigation expansion-induced cooling in Northwest China from 2000 to 2020". Please check here https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109304 for details.



**July 2022**

* [Paper online] My first-authored paper publised on *Remote Sensing of Environment*, introducing the improved irrigated cropland dataset across China for 2000-2019: "IrriMap_CN: Annual irrigation maps across China in 2000â€“2019 based on satellite observations, environmental variables, and machine learning".
