**2. Experience of Software Development**

[6] *Power Transmission Line Demolition Mapping Software, 2020 (copyright: 2020SR0469591)*

[Function] The Android client enables photo capture and recording of house attribute information, while the PC client allows for reading house information and generating mapping sheets.

[5] *Indoor Mapping Software for Power Transmission Line Surveys Based on AutoCAD, 2019 (copyright: 2020SR0472691)*

[Function] Developed based on AutoCAD, this software automatically generates tower base plans/sections and supports batch renaming of drawings.

[4] *Total Station Data Automatic Processing Software, 2018 (copyright: 2020SR0467614)*

[Function] Programmed in C#, it supports reading data from Leica Total Station GSI/XML files, calculating 3D coordinates of survey points, and outputting results in EXCEL/WORD formats.

[3] *GNSS Data Processing and Calculation Software, 2015*

[Function] Programmed in C, it performs single-point positioning and baseline calculations for GPS, BEIDOU, and GLONASS navigation systems. It also displays satellite sky plots, signal-to-noise ratio graphs, elevation and azimuth plots, and baseline residual plots.

[2] *Road Construction Staking Parameter Calculation Software, 2014*

[Function] Programmed in C++, it calculates elements of circular and compound curves for road construction staking and supports coordinate forward and reverse calculations for interchange ramp construction.

[1] *Survey Coordinate Conversion Software, 2013*

[Function] Programmed in C++, it enables conversion between different ellipsoid coordinate systems, as well as conversions between geodetic, spatial Cartesian, and Gauss plane coordinates under the same ellipsoid. It also supports four-parameter and seven-parameter calculations, and conversions between three-degree and six-degree zones.
